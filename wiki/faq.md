# Frequently Asked Questions

## How to Wildshape  
To use the built-in Wild Shape feature, open the character sheet of the actor that you would like to transform, then drag the actor they should transform into onto that character sheet (e.g. open the Druid's character sheet and drag the Wolf actor onto it). In the resulting pop-up dialog, click the Wild Shape button. This must be done by the Gamemaster, unless the System Setting "Allow Polymorphing" is enabled, the player must also have "Observer" access to the actors they can transform into and the permissions to "Create New Actors" and "Create New Tokens". To exit Wild Shape, open the actor sheet and click the Restore Transformation button in the sheet's title bar. Because Players cannot have permissions to delete actors, if used by a player the transformed actor will remain, if used by the Gamemaster the transformed actor will be deleted.   
Unsoluble has a great video guide available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjcugG_akk4  
(Note that as of 2.1.0 Unlinked Tokens can use the Restore Transformation feature, this video was recorded prior to version 2.1.0)

## How to create Spell Scrolls  
To create a Spell Scroll, drag a spell item onto an Actor's Inventory tab. The system will create a spell scroll for the level of the spell provided. The system appends the text of the spell into the Spell Scroll items in the Items (SRD) compendium.

## What are the plans for the upcoming OneDnD release?  
There is no decision on this and cannot be one until such a time as OneD&D is officially released for play. Due to potential licensing restrictions, lack of official clarity on what specific changes are being made in the final product, and a whole host of other issues, any speculation on support for One D&D at this point is fruitless.  
Most of the changes that we have seen so far are not entirely difficult to implement on your own in the current system, if you would like to implement rules, features, items, spells, or anything else you've seen so far in the playtest, hop in the discord and our helpers there would be happy to assist you.
