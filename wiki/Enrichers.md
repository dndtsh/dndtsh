![Up to date as of 3.2.0](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=dnd5e&message=3.2.0&color=informational)

The dnd5e system adds a number of useful enrichers that can be used within journals or in item or actor descriptions. These enrichers will generate text based on the standard formatting used throughout 5e releases and provide rolls and related behavior that properly hooks into the system.

## Check & Save Enrichers
Check and save enrichers allow for rolling ability checks, skill checks, tool checks, and saving throws using all of the proper modifiers of the character performing the roll.

It is very common for a feature description or journal entry to include a call for a saving throw. Now you can simply write `[[/save dex]]` and it will be formatted into `"[Dexterity]"`, with that text being a link that will open up the roll save dialog when clicked. By default only the ability is shown, but it can be expanded by writing `[[/save dex format=long]]` which will display as `"[Dexterity saving throw]"`.

The format also supports full-length ability names (e.g. `[[/save dexterity]]`) and prefixed terms (e.g. `[[/save ability=dex]]`) for greater clarity.

Including a DC in the roll will display it in the description and pass it through to the roll, highlighting in chat whether the result was a success or failure. A value of `[[/save dex 15]]` or `[[/save ability=dexterity dc=15]]` becomes `"[DC 15 Dexterity]"` or `"[DC 15 Dexterity saving throw]"` if `format=long` is set.

The DC can either be a fixed value or a resolved formula based on the stats of the owner of the item included in it. So adding `[[/save dex dc=@abilities.con.dc]]` will set to DC to whatever the pre-calculated constitution DC is on the creature that owns the item with this enricher.

Check, skill, and tool enrichers work in much the same way. Writing `[[/check {ability} {dc}]]` will create a basic ability check, while `[[/skill acrobatics]]` will present an acrobatics check.

![Enricher Passive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/publish-wiki/wiki/images/enricher-passive.jpg)

Using the `passive` option on a check enricher displays a passive description and allows the enhanced passive tooltip for characters that are part of the primary party. A standard passive perception check can be achieved by using `[[/skill perception 15 passive format=long]]` to produce the text `"passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or high"`, or the format option can be left out for the shorter `"DC 15 passive Wisdom (Perception)"`.

The `[[/check]]`, `[[/skill]]`, `[[/tool]]` starting terms are all interchangeable, and the final roll will be presented based on the inputs given. So `[[/check dexterity athletics]]` will perform a dexterity check using a character's athletics proficiency if present.

For skill checks, the ability is optional. If one is provided then the person rolling have that ability selected by default even if it isn't the default on their sheet. Otherwise they will use whatever ability is set for that skill on their character sheet.

For tool checks, the ability is required. A check like `[[/tool thief]]` will not parse because the ability must be explicitly set like `[[/tool thief dex]]`. A list of the tool ids to use for this enricher is provided below.

## Damage Enrichers
Unlike simple inline roll links (the old `[[/r 2d6]]`), damage enrichers allow for properly associating damage types with rolls, automatically calculating the average, and will present the damage roll dialog when clicked allowing them to rolled as criticals or modified with temporary bonuses.

The basic format of a damage enricher is `[[/damage {formula} {type}]]`, so one could write `[[/damage 2d6 fire]]` and it will be parsed as `"[2d6] fire"` in the final text, with the dice formula rollable. This could also be written with a more explicit syntax such as `[[/damage formula=2d6 type=fire]]` if that format is more to your liking.

For a format like shown in many places through 5e releases, you can use the `average` flag to auto-calculate the average. Typing `[[/damage 2d6 fire average]]` or `[[/damage 2d6 fire average=true]]` will result in `"7 ([2d6]) fire"`. If for some reason the system cannot automatically calulate the average or you wish to display something different, you can enter a custom value that will be displayed. So `[[/damage 2d6kh fire average=5]]` will display `"5 (2d6kh) fire"`.

The formula can also include formula values that will be evaluated before the damage is displayed in the condition. If you wanted to add a feature to a monster that includes its modifier in a damage roll, you might write `[[/damage 1d6 + @abilities.dex.mod slashing]]` and it will be parsed using whatever dexterity modifier is on the actor that owns the item.

> [!Note]
> Any values entered in the formula will be resolved based on the stats of the owner of the item, not who ultimately performs the roll.

### Healing Enricher
While healing can be provided using the standard damage enricher using one of the healing types (`healing` or `temp`), there is also a dedicated enricher to make it a bit clearer. This can be used in the format of `[[/healing {formula}]]` for normal healing and `[[/healing {formula} temp]]` for temporary HP. This also accepts the `average` parameter just like the damage enricher.


## Item Use Enrichers
Item enrichers allow you to use an item from an enriched link. There are several different methods to create an Item enricher, which will determine how the item is used:

**By Item Name**: `[[/item Bite]]`

This functions similarly to a system macro, as if you had dragged that item to the macro hotbar. When clicked, it will check for a selected token, or your assigned actor. If the token or actor has an item of a matching name, it will be used, otherwise a warning will be displayed.

**By Item & Activity Name**: `[[/item Bite activity=Poison]]`

Using the item name without an activity will cause the activity selection dialog to open if more than one activity is present. To trigger a specific activity on the item the activity name can be included. The activity name must be proceeded by `activity=`, and it must be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name (e.g. `[[/item Tentacles activity="Escape Tentacles"]]`).

**By UUID**: `[[/item Actor.p26xCjCCTQm5fRN3.Item.amUUCouL69OK1GZU]]`

A UUID contains references to an Actor and an Item it owns. When clicked, the enricher will find the specified Actor and use the specified Item.

**By Relative ID:** `[[/item amUUCouL69OK1GZU]]` or `[[/item .amUUCouL69OK1GZU]]`

A Relative ID can contain a reference to an owned Item either by an ID, or a relative UUID (note the preceding `.`). When clicked, the enricher will use its location (either in an Actor Sheet, Item Sheet, or Chat Card) to determine the Token or Actor that owns that card or sheet in order to use the specified item from that owner.

The activity name can also be used when referring to an item using its ID in the same manner as above with item name.

## Lookup Enrichers

The lookup enricher allows for referencing data within an actor's roll data and displaying it in a description. This is most useful for automatically including a creature's name (`[[lookup @name]]`) or their type (`[[lookup @details.type.config.label]]`), but can be used to reference any values normally available in [roll data](Roll-Formulas.md).

![Lookup Enricher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/publish-wiki/wiki/images/enricher-lookup.jpg)

A few additional parameters are available to transform the resulting text:
- `[[lookup @name lowercase]]`: Converts the text to all lowercase (e.g. "adult white dragon")
- `[[lookup @name uppercase]]`: Converts the text to all uppercase (e.g. "ADULT WHITE DRAGON")
- `[[lookup @name capitalize]]`: Capitalizes the first word in the text (e.g. "Adult white dragon")

## Reference Enrichers
The `&Reference` enricher allows for easy reference to rule pages and displays rich tooltips with the contents of a specific rule. It comes built-in with support for abilities, skills, conditions, damage types, and more.

![Enricher Reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/publish-wiki/wiki/images/enricher-reference.jpg)

Using the enricher is very simple, simply type `&Reference` with the name of the referenced rule included inside the square brackets. For example `&Reference[prone]` will include be converted to `[Prone]` which links to the prone page in the SRD rules and display a tooltip with the description of the prone condition.
