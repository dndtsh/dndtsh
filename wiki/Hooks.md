## Rolling Process

The rolling process includes a number of standard hooks that are called by most rolls performed by the system.

### `dnd5e.preRollV2`

A hook event that fires before a roll is performed. Multiple hooks may be called depending on the rolling method (e.g. `dnd5e.preRollSkillV2`, `dnd5e.preRollAbilityCheckV2`, `dnd5e.preRollV2`). Exact contents of the configuration object will also change based on the roll type, but the same objects will always be present. Returning `false` will prevent the normal rolling process.

| Name    | Type                           | Description                             |

| dialog  | BasicRollDialogConfiguration   | Configuration for the roll dialog.      |
| message | BasicRollMessageConfiguration  | Configuration for the roll message.     |

### `dnd5e.postRollConfiguration`

A hook event that fires after roll configuration is complete, but before the roll is evaluated. Multiple hooks may be called depending on the rolling method (e.g. `dnd5e.postSkillCheckRollConfiguration`, `dnd5e.postAbilityTestRollConfiguration`, and `dnd5e.postRollConfiguration` for skill checks). Exact contents of the configuration object will also change based on the roll type, but the same objects will always be present. Returning `false` will prevent the normal rolling process.

### Document Modification Context

All of the normal 'pre' and 'post' hook events for document modification when an advancement manager flow finishes (Actor Update, Item Creation, Item Update, and Item Deletion) have a custom flag on them: `isAdvancement`. This allows a hook listener to react differently to advancement-created hook events vs normal ones.

```js
Hooks.on('updateActor', (actor, change, options) => {
  if ( options.isAdvancement ) {
    // do something special
  }
})
```
