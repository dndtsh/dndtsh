If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap:</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each target creature takes <strong>3d10 force damage</strong>, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p><p>You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a <strong>melee spell attack</strong> against it. On a hit, the creature must make a <strong>Charisma saving throw</strong>. If the creature fails the save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify.

Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap:</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p><p>The entire warded area radiates magic. A @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell's caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.</p><p><strong>Solid Fog.</strong> You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.</p><p><strong>Grasping Undergrowth.</strong> You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an entangle spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.</p><p><strong>Grove Guardians.</strong> You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an <strong>awakened tree</strong>, except they can't speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The grove guardians can't leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible.</p><p><strong>Additional Spell Effect.</strong> You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:</p><ul><li>A constant @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{Gust of Wind} in two locations of your choice</li><li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.9gYGkrL6qFTsE6fw]{Spike Growth} in one location of your choice</li><li>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ew6GA8dJy2spQmFW]{Wind Wall} in two locations of your choice</li></ul><p>To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"minute","cost":10,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"24","units":"hour"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":30,"width":null,"units":"ft","type":"cube"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"touch"},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":6,"school":"abj","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":false,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"Mistletoe, which the spell consumes, that was harvested with a golden sickle under the light of a full moon","consumed":true,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":false},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":0,"flags":{},"img":"icons/magic/light/explosion-star-large-pink.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675986797532,"modifiedTime":1675989934123,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}}
