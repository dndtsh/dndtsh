      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)</em></p>\n<p>This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.</p>\n<p>Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly from @Compendium[dnd5e.tables.k04aalP3jahUyXqa]{Necklace of Prayer Beads}. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><em>**Foundry note: the 6 charges reflect the maximum number of beads able to be found; please adjust as required. </em></p>\n<p><em>Additionally, the guide price is a guide only and should be adjusted accordingly to reflect the Dungeon Master's world.</em></p>",
