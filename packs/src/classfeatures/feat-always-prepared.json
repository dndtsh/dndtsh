You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li>You can pull any item out of a backpack or other container that you have packed, regardless of whether or not you specifically put that item in the container. In order to do so, you must have had the opportunity to purchase the item in the last 30 days, you must immediately pay 1&frac12; times the item's market price, and the item must fit in whatever container you are pulling it out of. If the container has been thoroughly searched by anyone other than you, you cannot use this feature.</li>\n</ul>",
