      "value": "<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.4L3BN1VZV6A5SVZO]{Ranger spell list}. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level rounded up (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You also automatically have the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.0xmXiPiuYws1OGcX]{Hunter's Mark} spell prepared, which doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include five spells of 1st or 2nd level (plus @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.0xmXiPiuYws1OGcX]{Hunter's Mark}), in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.hDOENzjuj5WpLq7B]{Animal Friendship}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of ranger spells requires time spent in meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell changed on your list.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.</p>",
