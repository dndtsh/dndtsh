      "value": "<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to three times your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</p>\n<p>While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you expend a spell slot to cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to three times the slot's level.</p>\n<p>Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
