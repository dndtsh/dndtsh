      "value": "<p>Beginning at 6th level, as an action you can animate one Large or smaller nonmagical item you can see within 30 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. The animate item uses the Dancing Item stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus. The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.</p>\n<p>In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\n<p>When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration.</p>\n<p>Once you animate an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item animated by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.</p>",
