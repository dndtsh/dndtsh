As a bonus action, you can spend 5 ki points to summon the arms, visage, and body of your astral self and awaken it for 10 minutes. This awakening ends early if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\n<p>While your astral self is awakened, you gain the following benefits.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Armor of the Spirit.</em></strong> You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Astral Barrage.</em></strong> Whenever you use the Extra Attack feature to attack, you can attack one additional time if all the attacks are made with your astral arms.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>Forms of Your Astral Self</h5>\n<p>The astral self is a translucent embodiment of the monk's soul. As a result, an astral self can reflect aspects of a monk's history and personality, and an astral self doesn't necessarily look anything like the monk. For example, the astral self of a lanky human might be reminiscent of a minotaur &mdash; the strength of which the monk feels within. Similarly, a half-orc monk might manifest gossamer arms and a delicate visage, representing his inner beauty. Each astral self is unique, and some monks of this monastic tradition are known more for the appearance of their astral self than for their physical appearance.</p>\n</blockquote>",
