      "value": "<p>You have studied the workings of magic, how to channel it through objects, and how to awaken it within them. As a result, you have gained a limited ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders through various items.</p>\n<h3>Tools Required</h3>\n<p>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus \u2014 specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool\u2014in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5 for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.udsLtG0BugXHR2JQ]{Prestidigitation} and two cantrips of your choice from the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.O098CG3HJUY9Z9CZ]{Artificer spell list}. You learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.O098CG3HJUY9Z9CZ]{Artificer spell list}. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level rounded up (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent in tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>The Magic of Artifice</h5>\n<p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.NMEKYJAL9WBXCLRO]{Catapult} using alchemist's supplies, you could be quickly mixing rocket fuel. If you cast it using tinker's tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that acts as a spring. When you cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.g2u9PYfqWQAyg9OI]{Poison Spray}, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.NMEKYJAL9WBXCLRO]{Catapult} with @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XvbiNhNqXXIFisIy]{Shocking Grasp}, you might be breaking down the device and creating an different item in its place \u2014 perhaps a gauntlet that lets you channel a surge of energy.</p>\n<p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Ritual Casting</h3>\n<p>You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual<br/>if that spell has the ritual<br/>tag and you have that spell<br/>prepared.</p>",
