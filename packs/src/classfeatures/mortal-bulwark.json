As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on attack rolls against aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends.</li>\n<li>When you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also force it to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is magically banished to its native plane of existence if it's currently not there. On a successful save, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend <br/> a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.</p>",
