      "value": "<p>At 15th level, your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.</p>\n<p><strong>Guardian.</strong> When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.</p>\n<p>Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Infiltrator.</strong> Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against\nyou, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition,\nthe next attack roll against it has advantage, and if\nthat attack hits, the target takes an extra ld6 lightning\ndamage.</p>",
