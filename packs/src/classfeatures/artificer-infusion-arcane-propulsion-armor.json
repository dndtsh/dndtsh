The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.</li>\n<li>The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will.</li>\n<li>If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs-hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.</li>\n</ul>",
