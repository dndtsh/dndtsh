      "value": "<p>Beginning at 11th level, the power of your draconic spirit now radiates from you, warding your allies or inspiring fear in your enemies. As a bonus action, you can create an aura of draconic power that radiates 10 feet from you for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain one of the following effects of your choice:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> When you create this aura, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can choose a creature within the aura. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Resistance.</em></strong> Choose a damage type when you activate this aura: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You and your allies within the aura have resistance to that damage.</p>\n<p>Once you create this aura, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 3 ki points to create it again.</p>",
