      "value": "<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, and hunting certain types of enemies commonly encountered in the wilds.</p>\n<p>After you reduce a beast, fey, humanoid, monstrosity, or undead to 0 hit points, you can spend 10 minutes examining the creature for weaknesses. Thereafter, creatures of that species become one of your favored enemies. You can have a number of favored enemies equal to your proficiency bonus, and once you reach that limit you must replace one of your favored enemies when you attempt to select another. For example, when a ranger with a proficiency bonus of +2 and the favored enemies of \"goblin\" and \"elk\" kills a zombie and examines its corpse, the ranger can replace either \"goblin\" or \"elk\" with \"zombie\".</p>\n<p>You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against your favored enemies. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>",
