Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
