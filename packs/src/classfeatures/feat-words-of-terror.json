At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.</p>\n<p>If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
