      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world. With 8 hours of work, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select your companion from the <strong>animal companion</strong> stat block (choosing Air, Land, or Water). However, your DM might allow other creatures to act as animal companions.</p>\n<p>At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.</p>\n<p>If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body. If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Animal Companion</h2>\n<p><em>Medium or smaller beast</em></p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class</strong> 10 + your proficiency bonus</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10 + 3 times your ranger level + 2 times your character level</li>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.; fly 30 ft.
