As a bonus action, you cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.arzCrMRgcNiQuh43]{Command}, without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.arzCrMRgcNiQuh43]{Command} as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.arzCrMRgcNiQuh43]{Command} you cast with this feature.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
