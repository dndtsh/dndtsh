As a bonus action, or as part of the bonus action you take to activate Arms of the Astral Self, you can spend 1 ki point to summon this visage for 10 minutes. It vanishes early if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\n<p>The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance, and gain the following benefits while the spectral visage is present.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Astral Sight.</em></strong> You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wisdom of the Spirit.</em></strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Word of the Spirit.</em></strong> When you speak, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you, making it so only that creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can hear you.</p>",
