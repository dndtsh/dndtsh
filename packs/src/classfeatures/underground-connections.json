      "value": "<p>By 5th level, you have accumulated a series of underground connections, and have learned how to contact people who can get you what you want &mdash; for a price. While you are in a settlement, you can purchase goods, services, or other purchasable items for a price set by the DM. For example, you might purchase an invitation to the royal ball (normally open only to the nobility), a rare magic sword otherwise unavailable for sale in the town, a skeleton key to the city's jail cells, healing services from a disgruntled druid, or a map leading to an ancient burial vault filled with treasure. Such an item is usually more expensive than it's normal market price, or has strings attached.</p>",
