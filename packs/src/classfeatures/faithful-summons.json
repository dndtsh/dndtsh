      "value": "<p>Starting at 14th level, the nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or are incapacitated against your will, you can immediately summon four beasts of your choice that are challenge rating 2 or lower, which act at the end of your turn. The conjured beasts appear within 20 feet of you. If they receive no commands from you, they protect you from harm and attack your foes. The beasts remain for 1 hour, requiring no concentration, or until you dismiss them (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
