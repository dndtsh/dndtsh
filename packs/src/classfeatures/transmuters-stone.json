      "value": "<p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</li>\n<li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered.</li>\n<li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws.</li>\n<li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)</li>\n<li>The ability to cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.8RTDOt80u8aBv9qx]{Alter Self} spell without expending a spell slot. The creature loses concentration on the spell if the stone isn't in its possession.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.</p>\n<p>If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.</p>",
