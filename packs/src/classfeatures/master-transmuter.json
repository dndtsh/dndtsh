      "value": "<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Major Transformation.</em></strong> You can transmute one object \u2014 no larger than a 5-foot cube \u2014 into another object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Panacea.</em></strong> You remove all harmful spells, curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Restore Energy.</em></strong> You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature regains some expended spell slots. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Restore Life.</em></strong> You cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{Raise Dead} spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Restore Youth.</em></strong> You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's physical age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years.</p>",
