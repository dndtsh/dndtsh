You start with three such effects: Turn Undead, Harness Divine Power, and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\n<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell DC.</p>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.r91UIgwFdHwkXdia]{Turn Undead}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.X1FFYNKZU4Z59G7O]{Harness Divine Power}</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
