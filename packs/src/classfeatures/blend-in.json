If you are traveling with a group that would be detected as the result of a failed Dexterity (Stealth) check, you remain hidden if your own Dexterity (Stealth) check would have succeeded on the check.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you are hidden from a creature and either you or the creature moves such that you would be clearly visible, you can choose to remain hidden as a reaction.</p>",
