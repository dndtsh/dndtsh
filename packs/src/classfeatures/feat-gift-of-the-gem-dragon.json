      "value": "<p>You've manifested some of the power of gem dragons, granting you the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>\n<li><strong>Telekinetic Reprisal.</strong> When you take damage from a creature that is within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to emanate telekinetic energy. The creature that dealt damage to you must make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>",
