      "value": "<p>At 20th level, as a bonus action you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the start of each of your turns, if you have at least 1 hit point remaining, you regain 10 hit points.</li>\n<li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li>\n<li>Enemy creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.</p>",
