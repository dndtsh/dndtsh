As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\n<li>Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
