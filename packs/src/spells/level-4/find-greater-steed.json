      "value": "<p>You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a loyal, majestic mount. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form you choose: a griffon, a pegasus, a peryton, a dire wolf, a rhinoceros, or a saber-toothed tiger. The creature has the statistics provided in the Monster Manual for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.</p><p>The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re-summons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed.</p><p>You can't have more than one mount bonded by this spell or @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5eh2HFbS13078Y3H]{Find Steed} at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently.</p><p>Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.</p>",
