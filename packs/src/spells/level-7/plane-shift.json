      "value": "<p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you may appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM's discretion. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Familiarity</th><th align=\"center\">Mishap</th><th align=\"center\">Similar Area</th><th align=\"center\">On Target</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">Permanent Circle</td><td align=\"center\"></td><td align=\"center\"></td><td align=\"center\">01\u201300</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Associated object</td><td align=\"center\"></td><td align=\"center\"></td><td align=\"center\">01\u201300</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Very familiar</td><td align=\"center\">01\u201305</td><td align=\"center\">06\u201324</td><td align=\"center\">25\u201300</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Seen casually</td><td align=\"center\">01\u201333</td><td align=\"center\">34\u201353</td><td align=\"center\">54\u201300</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Viewed once</td><td align=\"center\">01\u201343</td><td align=\"center\">44\u201373</td><td align=\"center\">74\u201300</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">Description</td><td align=\"center\">01\u201343</td><td align=\"center\">44\u201373</td><td align=\"center\">74\u201300</td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">False destination</td><td align=\"center\">01\u201350</td><td align=\"center\">51\u201300</td><td align=\"center\"></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Familiarity:</strong> \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle on a different plane of existence whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.</p><p>\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map. \"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to arrive in a familiar location that no longer exists.</p><p><strong>On Target:</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap:</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each target creature takes <strong>3d10 force damage</strong>, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p><p>You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a <strong>melee spell attack</strong> against it. On a hit, the creature must make a <strong>Charisma saving throw</strong>. If the creature fails the save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence, should it wish to return.</p>",
