      "value": "<p>When you cast this spell, you ward an immobile, hidden location (such as a town, a building, a grotto, or a geographic feature) known only to yourself and willing creatures within range. If this location is known to any creature not targeted by this spell, the spell fails.</p><p>The targets of this spell are bound to secrecy, unable to divulge the secret location directly or indirectly, even through spells such as @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ppWAAEul0QHtm4er]{Detect Thoughts}. The location cannot be discovered with any divination magic. Only you can divulge the secret, and anyone you divulge it to is similarly affected by this spell.</p><p>A creature unaffected by this spell who would happen upon the secret location accidentally must make an <strong>Intelligence saving throw</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is incapable of perceiving the location, rationalizing away anything that might lead it to suspect the truth. On a successful save, the creature becomes subject to this spell.</p><p>You can dismiss this spell as an action, and the spell ends if you die. If you spend more than 1 consecutive hour in any location hidden by @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.EY65K5XJT680IQ6F]{Hide Location}, then your spell has a cumulative 5% chance of ending early every hour.</p>",
