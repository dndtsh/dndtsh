      "value": "<p>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature that uses the Undead Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature's form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The creature rises as an undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.</p><p>The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.</p><p>The creature is under your control for the duration of the spell, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature, you must cast this spell on the creature again. This use of the spell reasserts your control over a creature you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels:</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.</p>",
