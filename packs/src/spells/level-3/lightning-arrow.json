Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes <strong>4d8 lightning damage</strong> on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage. On a hit, the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p><p>Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a <strong>Dexterity saving throw</strong>. Each of these creatures takes <strong>2d8 lightning damage</strong> on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, a creature that fails its saving throw cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p><p>The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels:</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>",
