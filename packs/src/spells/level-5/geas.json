If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes <strong>5d10 psychic damage</strong> each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.</p><p>You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.</p><p>You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration}, or @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell also ends it.</p><p><strong><em>At Higher Levels:</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.</p>",
