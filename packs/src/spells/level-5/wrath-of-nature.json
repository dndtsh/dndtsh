      "value": "<p>You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Grasses and Undergrowth:</strong> Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.</p><p><strong>Trees:</strong> At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a <strong>Dexterity saving throw</strong> or take <strong>4d6 slashing damage</strong> from whipping branches.</p><p><strong>Roots and Vines:</strong> At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a <strong>Strength saving throw</strong> or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p><strong>Rock:</strong> As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a <strong>ranged spell attack</strong> against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a <strong>Strength saving throw</strong> or fall prone.</p>",
