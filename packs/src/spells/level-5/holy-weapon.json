In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra <strong>2d8 radiant damage</strong> on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a <strong>Constitution saving throw</strong>. On a failed save, a creature takes <strong>4d8 radiant damage</strong>, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a <strong>Constitution saving throw</strong>, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>",
