When you cast the spell, choose one of the following rites, the target of which must be within 10 feet of you throughout the casting.</p><p><strong><em>Atonement:</em></strong> You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed, and you make a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment.</p><p><strong><em>Bless Water:</em></strong> You touch one vial of water and cause it to become holy water.</p><p><strong><em>Coming of Age:</em></strong> You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p><p><strong><em>Dedication:</em></strong> You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god's service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p><p><strong><em>Funeral Rite:</em></strong> You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can't become undead by any means short of a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell.</p><p><strong><em>Wedding:</em></strong> You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.</p>",
