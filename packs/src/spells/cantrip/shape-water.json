You manipulate it in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li>You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.</li><li>You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.:</li><li>You change the water's color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li><li>You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.</li></ul><p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>",
