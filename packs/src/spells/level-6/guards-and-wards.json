      "value": "<p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p><p>Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.</p><p><strong>Corridors:</strong> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p><p><strong>Doors:</strong> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Lock} spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.oIzA2MEHwxhtQneU]{Minor Illusion} spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p><p><strong>Stairs:</strong> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.UJJu9c2UvCzVljiP]{Web} spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.</p><p><strong>Other Spell Effect:</strong> You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.</p><ul><li>Place @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CAxSzHWizrafT033]{Dancing Lights} in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.yw0tYQkOMCgKZ8Ur]{Guards and Wards} lasts.</li><li>Place @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.7v06rdmUakoTk1LQ]{Magic Mouth} in two locations.</li><li>Place @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TwlD4PLcltv7Xh7j]{Stinking Cloud} in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.yw0tYQkOMCgKZ8Ur]{Guards and Wards} lasts.</li><li>Place a constant @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{Gust of Wind} in one corridor or room.</li><li>Place a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{Suggestion} in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.</li></ul><p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.</p><p>You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.</p>",
