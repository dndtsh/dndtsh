      "value": "<p>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell, called the contingent spell, as part of casting @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.4smlOvpF5AQHcyg1]{Contingency}, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.4smlOvpF5AQHcyg1]{Contingency} cast with @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.13uVuBQP6VaiSPvC]{Water Breathing} might stipulate that @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.13uVuBQP6VaiSPvC]{Water Breathing} comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.4smlOvpF5AQHcyg1]{Contingency} ends.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.4smlOvpF5AQHcyg1]{Contingency} spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.4smlOvpF5AQHcyg1]{Contingency} spell on you ends. Also, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.4smlOvpF5AQHcyg1]{Contingency} ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>",
