You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing armor, or if you are encumbered.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Nimble.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Cjtl6XIwR5p3YEah]{Nimble} As a Tiny flying creature, you are hard to hit. While you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.chPl18Tq4gZpeqHu]{Fey Ancestry} You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Challenges of a Tiny Characters</h4>\n<p>Playing a Tiny character comes with significant challenges.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Carrying Capacity.</em></strong> As a Tiny character, your carrying capacity is halved compared to a creature of Small or Medium size.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Equipment.</em></strong> As a Tiny creature, you typically cannot use equipment sized for Small or Medium creatures. Equipment sized for Tiny creatures costs half as much and weighs one quarter as much. Most magic weaponry and armor is unusable, though you can gain the benefits of items such as rings by wearing them as bracelets or a crown.</p>\n<p>Tiny-sized weapons have the same properties as their Small- and Medium-sized counterparts, but deal reduced damage. Consult the following table to determine the damage a weapon sized for a Tiny creature deals:</p>\n<h5>Tiny Weapon Damage</h5>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Medium Damage</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Tiny Damage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">1, 1d4, or 1d6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">1d8 or 2d4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">1d10, 1d12, or 2d6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
