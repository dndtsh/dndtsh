      "value": "<p>Your tortle character gains traits that enable it to cope with the perils of a savage world.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood by the age of 15 and live an average of 150 years.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 400 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.meIBgE5Uz9OQNaAz]{Claws} Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hold Breath.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.oAi0DjoYV4X9Xfaj]{Hold Breath} You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren't natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Natural Armor.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.q1muB6eBqG9IigRT]{Natural Armor} Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Shell Defense.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.xxVtvHeAAk8je7hO]{Shell Defense} You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, you are immobilized, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
