Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Human Determination.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.35BKyuNiBrnBRJIQ]{Human Determination} You are filled with a determination that can draw the unreachable within your reach. When you fail an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can choose to re-roll the d20. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Human Curiosity.</em></strong> Your natural curiosity leads you to dabble in a variety of activities. You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Human Persistence.</em></strong> Even when on death's door, you cling to life with your fingertips. When you make a death saving throw, you can add your proficiency bonus.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
