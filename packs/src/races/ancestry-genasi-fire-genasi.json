      "value": "<p>Your genasi character has certain characteristics in common with all other genasi.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Elemental Scion.</em></strong> Four major types of genasi are found among the worlds of D&amp;D: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these types.</p>\n<h4>Fire Genasi</h4>\n<p>As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.</p>\n<p>Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fire Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to fire damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reach to the Blaze.</em></strong> You know the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.eCPQuQkIabFKTl9u]{Produce Flame} cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5SuJewoa1CRWaj1F]{Burning Hands} spell once with this trait as a 1st-level spell, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
