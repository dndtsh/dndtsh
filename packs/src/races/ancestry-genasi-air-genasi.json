      "value": "<p>Your genasi character has certain characteristics in common with all other genasi.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Elemental Scion.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.HjYmUqZdQhES0G5M]{Elemental Scion} Four major types of genasi are found among the worlds of D&amp;D: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these types.</p>\n<h4>Air Genasi</h4>\n<p>As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.</p>\n<p>Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Unending Breath.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.CTx0JPz2YZagtbvK]{Unending Breath} You can hold your breath indefinitely while you're not incapacitated.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cloud Step.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.TiOzddywvo4Th7DR]{Cloud Step} Your base walking speed increases to 40 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mingle with the Wind.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.zQNbpSqiNvwD2gY7]{Mingle with the Wind} You can cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.MRxldJd6C4bsBo3O]{Levitate} spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{Gust of Wind} spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
