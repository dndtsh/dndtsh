      "value": "<p>Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n- <strong><em>Infernal Endurance.</em></strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\n- <strong><em>Infernal Toughness.</em></strong> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\n- <strong><em>Infernal Wings.</em></strong> You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulder blades, which double your jump height and distance. Beginning at 5th level, while you are not wearing medium or heavy armor and you are not encumbered, you have a flying speed of 30 feet.\n- <strong><em>Infernal Legacy.</em></strong> You know the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.MUO1uYN7JR1hm4dR]{Thaumaturgy} cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.22dPoeXfaaAv4K3h]{Hellish Rebuke} spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq]{Darkness} spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>",
