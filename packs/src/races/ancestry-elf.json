      "value": "<p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven ancestry.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Elves range from under 5 feet to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 35 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Second Sight.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.WPE7uOJaGVaIUhlD]{Second Sight} Famed for their innate ability to perceive things beyond the sight of other ancestries, you can use an action to cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ghXTfe7sgCbgf1Q8]{Detect Magic} spell without expending a spell slot. Once used, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.Ok2qkiLcA90hD1jN]{Fey Ancestry} You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Trance.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.VuvUfH01CoNLt3ie]{Trance} Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious for 4 hours a day. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Beast Speech.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.H75xEJQ2SEgxLjzk]{Beast Speech} You know the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.aL1F8fvYLtNzUbKu]{Speak with Animals} spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
