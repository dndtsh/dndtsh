Equipment sized for Tiny creatures costs half as much and weighs one quarter as much. Most magic weaponry and armor is unusable, though you can gain the benefits of items such as rings by wearing them as bracelets or a crown.</p>\n<p>Tiny-sized weapons have the same properties as their Small- and Medium-sized counterparts, but deal reduced damage. Consult the following table to determine the damage a weapon sized for a Tiny creature deals:</p>\n<h5>Tiny Weapon Damage</h5>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Medium Damage</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Tiny Damage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">1, 1d4, or 1d6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">1d8 or 2d4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">1d10, 1d12, or 2d6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>",
