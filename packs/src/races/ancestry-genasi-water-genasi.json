      "value": "<p>Your genasi character has certain characteristics in common with all other genasi.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Elemental Scion.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.HjYmUqZdQhES0G5M]{Elemental Scion} Four major types of genasi are found among the worlds of D&amp;D: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these types.</p>\n<h4>Water Genasi</h4>\n<p>The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths \u2014 all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.</p>\n<p>Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi's hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Acid Resistance.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.0kSBK375Z7nTRdVO]{Acid Resistance} You have resistance to acid damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.i8xFoDExZiQGA2Q8]{Amphibious} You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe air and water.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Call to the Wave.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.RBbGtY4OmUmpzcu1]{Call to the Wave} You know the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.A6OC2G477EL1FA2O]{Shape Water} cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.a3XtAO5n2GrqiAh5]{Create or Destroy Water} spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
