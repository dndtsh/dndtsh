      "value": "<p>Goliaths share a number of traits in common with each other.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Goliaths are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Stone's Endurance.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.RZzClbmnTYV1Uhpw]{Stone's Endurance} You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution score to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powerful Build.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.Gu3XzUVMLkk6Uzc8]{Powerful Build} You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mountain Born.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.ikTxCJH1kBot8mna]{Mountain Born} You're acclimated to high altitude, including elevations about 20,000 feet. You're also naturally adapted to cold climates, and have resistance to cold damage.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
