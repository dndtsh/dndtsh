      "value": "<p>Your warforged character has the following traits.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Some warforged are believed to be thousands of years old. The maximum lifespan of the warforged remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. Most warforged stand between 5 and 6\u00bd feet tall.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Warforged Resilience.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.VcGw7rmaneoaQv1d]{Warforged Resilience} As a construct partially made of stone or metal, you have remarkable fortitude:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.</li>\n<li>You are immune to disease.</li>\n<li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>\n<li>You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.</li>\n<li>When you roll a 9 or lower on a death saving throw, treat the roll as a 10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Sentry's Rest.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.0YRsVSKSdXBKh2vy]{Sentry's Rest} When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Integrated Armor.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.sNvaYSTqojLrPdxs]{Integrated Armor} When you are not wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. During a short rest, you can bond a suit of armor you are wearing to your body. When you finish that short rest, the armor you are wearing is bonded to you, and it cannot subsequently be removed from your body until you finish another short rest during which time you remove the bonded armor.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Powerful Build.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.UWDxMgq7nPx6TSlf]{Powerful Build} You count as a Large creature when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
