Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Hellish Resistance.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.brdRR7lNMIaonpHS]{Hellish Resistance} You have resistance to fire damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Fiendish Gift.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.HE7JnOEZzLwWdgSQ]{Fiendish Gift} You choose one of the following features:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Infernal Claws.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.maBHEZ6qWMhfcawM]{Infernal Claws} Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n- <strong><em>Infernal Endurance.</em></strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\n- <strong><em>Infernal Toughness.</em></strong> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.\n- <strong><em>Infernal Wings.</em></strong> You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulder blades, which double your jump height and distance.

Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.S7VbUetIfVT7B6Eq]{Darkness} spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Innate Language.</em></strong> @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.hk92ibPxJ3lRadyC]{Innate Language} You can speak, read, and write Infernal.</p>\n<section class=\"secret foundry-note\">\n<p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p>\n<p>You can drag your choices from the above onto your character sheet and it will automatically update.</p>\n</section>",
