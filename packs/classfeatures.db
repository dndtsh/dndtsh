You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different option each time.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Abjure Enemy.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>\n<p>On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature is also immobilized.</p>\n<p>On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Arcane Abjuration.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Champion Challenge.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away from you. This effect ends on the creature if you are incapacitated or die or if the creature is moved more than 30 feet away from you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Charm Animals and Plants.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Conquering Presence.</em></strong> As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Destructive Wrath.</em></strong> When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Emissary of Peace.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your presence with divine power. As a bonus action, you grant yourself a +5 bonus to Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the next 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Guided Strike.</em></strong> When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Invoke Duplicity.</em></strong> As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.</p>\n<p>For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Knowledge of the Ages.</em></strong> As an action, you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Nature's Wrath.</em></strong> As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Preserve Life.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric or paladin level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Radiance of the Dawn.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric or paladin level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rebuke the Violent.</em></strong> Immediately after an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sacred Weapon.</em></strong> As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p>\n<p>You can end this effect on your turn (no action required). If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Touch of Death.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice your cleric or paladin level.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Turn the Faithless.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p>If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Turn the Tide.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if it has no more than half of its hit points.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Turn the Unholy.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vow of Enmity.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"feat","subtype":""},"requirements":"Channel Divinity class feature","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1676491015292,"modifiedTime":1676491015292,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}}

{"_id":"RKIU8MUU42VB7JZB","name":"Spellcasting (Artificer)","ownership":{"default":0},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have studied the workings of magic, how to channel it through objects, and how to awaken it within them. As a result, you have gained a limited ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders through various items.</p>\n<h3>Tools Required</h3>\n<p>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus — specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5 for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.udsLtG0BugXHR2JQ]{Prestidigitation} and two cantrips of your choice from the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.O098CG3HJUY9Z9CZ]{Artificer spell list}. You learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.O098CG3HJUY9Z9CZ]{Artificer spell list}. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level rounded up (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent in tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>The Magic of Artifice</h5>\n<p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.NMEKYJAL9WBXCLRO]{Catapult} using alchemist's supplies, you could be quickly mixing rocket fuel. If you cast it using tinker's tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that acts as a spring. When you cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.g2u9PYfqWQAyg9OI]{Poison Spray}, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\n<p>The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.NMEKYJAL9WBXCLRO]{Catapult} with @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XvbiNhNqXXIFisIy]{Shocking Grasp}, you might be breaking down the device and creating an different item in its place — perhaps a gauntlet that lets you channel a surge of energy.</p>\n<p>Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Ritual Casting</h3>\n<p>You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual<br/>if that spell has the ritual<br/>tag and you have that spell<br/>prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Artificer 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/cog-orange-red.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675986804504,"modifiedTime":1676491016514,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}}

For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5SuJewoa1CRWaj1F]{Burning Hands}, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p>\n<p>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.</p>\n<h3>Spells and Ki Points</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Monk Levels</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Maximum Ki Points for a Spell</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">5th- 8th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">9th-12th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">13th-16th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">17th-20th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order.

Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n<p>For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h5>Your Spellbook</h5>\n<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Copying a Spell into the Book.</em></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Replacing the Book.</em></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book — for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 1 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Book's Appearance.</em></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap. It may not even be a book, but some other form, such as a bag of runed stones, or leather strips with spells inscribed wrapped around a staff.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"special","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":1,"max":"1","per":"lr","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"The wizard can recover this number worth of spells slots (of 5th-level or lower):","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"ceil(@classes.wizard.levels/2)","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Wizard 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/magic/earth/explosion-lava-stone-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234399,"modifiedTime":1675986801801,"lastModifiedBy":"dnd5ebuilder0000"}}

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours.

Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size.
